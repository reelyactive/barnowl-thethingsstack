barnowl-thethingsstack
======================

__barnowl-thethingsstack__ converts the decodings of _any_ ambient LoRaWAN devices by [The Things Stack](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/stack/) into standard developer-friendly JSON that is vendor/technology/application-agnostic.

__barnowl-thethingsstack__ is a lightweight [Node.js package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/barnowl-thethingsstack) that can run on resource-constrained edge devices as well as on powerful cloud servers and anything in between.  It is included in reelyActive's [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere/) open source middleware suite, and can just as easily be run standalone behind a [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) instance, as detailed in the code examples below.


Getting Started
---------------

Learn "owl" about the __raddec__ JSON data output:
-  [reelyActive Developer's Cheatsheet](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/cheatsheet/)


Quick Start
-----------

Clone this repository, install package dependencies with `npm install`, and then from the root folder run at any time:

    npm start

__barnowl-thethingsstack__ will indiscriminately accept HTTP POSTs on localhost:3001/thethingsstack and output (flattened) __raddec__ JSON to the console.


Hello barnowl-thethingsstack!
-----------------------------

Developing an application directly from __barnowl-thethingsstack__?  Start by pasting the code below into a file called server.js:

```javascript
const Barnowl = require('barnowl');
const BarnowlTheThingsStack = require('barnowl-thethingsstack');

let barnowl = new Barnowl({ enableMixing: true });

barnowl.addListener(BarnowlTheThingsStack, {},
                    BarnowlTheThingsStack.HttpListener, { port: 3001 });

barnowl.on('raddec', (raddec) => {
  console.log(raddec);
  // Trigger your application logic here
});
```

From the same folder as the server.js file, install package dependencies with the commands `npm install barnowl-thethingsstack` and `npm install barnowl`.  Then run the code with the command `node server.js` and observe the stream of radio decodings (raddec objects) output to the console:

```javascript
{
  transmitterId: "70b3d57ed8001e9e",
  transmitterIdType: 1,
  rssiSignature: [
    {
      receiverId: "001bc50940840000",
      receiverIdType: 1,
      rssi: -99,
      numberOfDecodings: 1
    }
  ],
  packets: [ "1d02ba02ca00" ],
  timestamp: 1645568542222
}
```

See the [Supported Listener Interfaces](#supported-listener-interfaces) below to adapt the code to listen for your stack(s).


Supported Listener Interfaces
-----------------------------

The following listener interfaces are supported by __barnowl-thethingsstack__.  Extend the [Hello barnowl-thethingsstack!](#hello-barnowl-thethingsstack) example above by pasting in any of the code snippets below.

### HTTP

The _recommended_ implementation is using [express](https://expressjs.com/) as follows:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');

let app = express();
let server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(3001, function() { console.log('Listening on port 3001'); });

let options = { app: app, express: express, route: "/thethingsstack" }; 
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlTheThingsStack, {},
                    BarnowlTheThingsStack.HttpListener, options);
```

Nonetheless, for testing purposes, __barnowl-thethingsstack__ can also create a minimal HTTP server as an alternative to express, and attempt to handle any POST it receives:

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlTheThingsStack, {},
                    BarnowlTheThingsStack.HttpListener, { port: 3001 });
```

### Test

Provides a steady stream of simulated IoT Device Interface messages for testing purposes.

```javascript
barnowl.addListener(BarnowlTheThingsStack, {},
                    BarnowlTheThingsStack.TestListener, {});
```


Is that owl you can do?
-----------------------

While __barnowl-thethingsstack__ may suffice standalone for simple real-time applications, its functionality can be greatly extended with the following software packages:
- [barnowl](https://github.com/reelyactive/barnowl) to combine parallel streams of RF decoding data in a technology-and-vendor-agnostic way

These packages and more are bundled together as the [Pareto Anywhere](https://www.reelyactive.com/pareto/anywhere) open source middleware suite, which includes a variety of __barnowl-x__ listeners, APIs and interactive web apps.
